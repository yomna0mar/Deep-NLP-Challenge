# Deep-NLP-Challenge
Working with Kaggle's Deep NLP Chatbot Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/samdeeplearning/deepnlp

# Trained Model
The trained model is created within deep_nlp_module.py.
This is where all the data extraction and preprocessing happens as well as the feature extraction.
If you actually want to have a chat with the chatbot, you can clone this project, making sure that the file paths remain the same!
All the code for the primitive chatbot can be found in artificial_agent.py.

If you want to see the accuracy measures of the all models, make sure you run deep_nlp_program.py

To run any code, you can use an IDE or simply calling the .py file from the command line "python ./{filename}.py".
Make sure that you are in the directory that contains the .py file before running it from the command line!
